The base pelican theme for my site, jeffmackinnon.com

There are some variables that you can add to the ``pelicanconf.py`` file that make things look good.

.. code:: python
    
    #
    # JeffTheme variables
    #

    ## The search things
    DUCKDUCKGOSEARCHURL = '' # The URL of your site
    ## Sidebar things
    BIO_IMAGE = '' # Make sure that this is in the "images" folder
    ## The Social Things
    SOCIAL_TWITTER = 'jeffmackinnon'
    SOCIAL_GITHUB = 'Jeffmackinnon'
    SOCIAL_LINKEDIN = 'jeffmackinnon'
    SOCIAL_FLICKR = 'jeffmackinnon'
    MICROBLOG = 'microblog' # not used .... yet
    ## Contact information for the footer
    CONTACT_PHONE_NUM = ''
    CONTACT_EMAIL = ''
    CONTACT_HOME_ADDR = ''
    CONTACT_BUSINESS_ADDR =''

You can copy the entire thing into your ``pelicanconf.py`` file and make the changes for your site.
